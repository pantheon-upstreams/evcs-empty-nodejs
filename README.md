# Pantheon ICR Empty Upstream for Drupal

This is an empty repository that is saved for this explanatory text, devoid of all content. This upstream is used for EVCS sites to create Nodejs sites. If this README persists after the site creation, it will do no harm; however, it would be advisable to replace this text with a description of the project.
